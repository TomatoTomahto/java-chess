# java-chess

Chess game implemented using Java with a Swing UI, using an MVC design.

It supports adding new piece types with different move styles. I have included two special pieces: the Archbishop (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_(chess)) and the Squirrel (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairy_chess_piece).

Slightly modified piece icons from: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:PNG_chess_pieces/Standard_transparent.
